Syncing Your Coursera Account

The interactive text for the course (including programming assignments) is automatically synced with your grade in the class (using the Learning Tools Interoperability protocol). When you open the textbook page for the first time, you'll see a prompt (starting with "This course utilizes third party learning tools hosted by service providers such as stepic.org"), asking for your permission to sync your progress through the text.


Course format

The course will consist primarily of an interactive textbook, Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach, along with lecture videos to accompany this textbook.

We will cover two chapters of content from Vol. 1 of this textbook, each covering two weeks of material. An e-book containing these two chapters can be obtained from LeanPub.

Each week will have a summary quiz.

This course also features a "Bioinformatics Application Challenge" in which you will learn about popular motif finding tools and apply them to analyzing a real experimental dataset.

This course features two "learner tracks", a "biologist track" (for students who do not know how to program yet) and a "hacker track" (for students who know how to program). The track you choose will dictate which of the assessments you should take. (Note that we are not implying that if you are a biologist by training, then you should avoid the "hacker track".)



Posting code

Please do not post code to discussion forum posts or public repositories.  However, you may share your solutions with other students in the class by solving the problems in the Rosalind Bioinformatics Textbook Track, which are mostly the same as the code challenges in this class (they accompany the printed version of the textbook). When you solve a problem correctly on Rosalind, you have the option to upload your code, which will be posted to a special "Solutions" forum, where you can see the best solutions from other users.


Grading policy

This course features two "learner tracks", a "biologist track" (for inexperienced programmers) and a "hacker track" (for experienced programmers). The track you choose will dictate which of the assessments you should take.  There are three types of assessments in this course:

Weekly quizzes testing comprehension of the course textbook.
A Bioinformatics Application Challenge letting you explore popular bioinformatics software built on the ideas presented in the course.
Code Challenges (programming assignments) hosted in the interactive text.
All students should complete the weekly quizzes (40 points).

The "biologist track" constitutes a Statement of Accomplishment or Verified Certificate. To complete the biologist track, you should complete the quizzes based on the course text as well as the Bioinformatics Application Challenge (40 points) and obtain a total of at least 60 (out of 80) points.  Code Challenge points will not be included in this grade.

The "hacker track" constitutes a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction or a Verified Certificate with Distinction. To complete the hacker track, you should complete the quizzes as well as the code challenges (145 points) and obtain a total of at least 135 (out of 185) points. Note: Each code challenge has a version in the main text that counts toward your grade, which links to an optional code-graded version that provides feedback on your code (for certain coding languages). Bioinformatics Application Challenge points will not be included in this grade.

All assignments must be completed before they are due to receive full credit.  After assignments are due, there is a 1-week grace period during which quizzes can receive half credit.
